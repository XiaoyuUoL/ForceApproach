A repository contains the following data:

## i. Table of CSD ID and $\lambda_\mathrm{force}$ for 4476 molecules in layer (i). (i.csv)
## ii. Table of CSD ID with $\lambda_\mathrm{force}$ and $\lambda_\mathrm{4p}$ for 282 molecules computed in layer (ii). (ii.csv)
## iii. Ground and excited state optimized geometry for 282 molecules in layer (ii). (iii.zip consisting of S0/S1 geometry folders)
## iv. Ground and excited state optimized geometry for 17 molecules computed at level layer (iii). (iv.zip consisting of S0/S1 geometry folders)
## v. ZINC ID, SMILES, $\lambda_\mathrm{force}$, $\lambda_\mathrm{4p}$ and ground state geometry for the 391 molecules used in the preliminary study shown in Figure 2 of the main manuscript. (v.zip consisting of S0 geometry folder and v.csv file. P.S. We randomly select 391 molecules from the ZINC dataset, and 336 in 391 get 'normal termination' for S1 optimization. i.e., 391 geometries in S0 folder and 336 lines in v.csv file).
